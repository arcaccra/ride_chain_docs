## Overview

Ridechain is a decentralized ride-sharing and logistics platform built on the Cardano blockchain. It aims to connect riders and drivers in a secure, transparent, and efficient manner using blockchain-based smart contracts and decentralized identity solutions. The project leverages the power of decentralized infrastructure to create a trustless, fair, and community-owned alternative to traditional ride-hailing services.

## Goals and Vision

- **Transparency and Fairness:** Eliminate intermediaries to ensure fair pricing and equitable driver compensation.
- **Decentralization:** Provide a community-owned and governed platform using Cardano's governance model.
- **Inclusion:** Offer ride-sharing and logistics services to underserved and unbanked populations through blockchain-based wallets and microtransactions.
- **Sustainability:** Promote eco-friendly travel and integrate carbon tracking and offsetting features.

## Architecture

The Ridechain system architecture is modular and composed of the following core components:

- **Frontend:** Mobile and web applications for drivers and riders.
- **Backend:** FastAPI-based service layer for routing, pricing, and matching.
- **Blockchain Layer:** Cardano smart contracts for escrow, identity, and governance.
- **Decentralized Identity:** DID solutions to verify drivers, riders, and service providers.
- **Data Storage:** IPFS and/or cloud for non-sensitive metadata.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** For community reporting, metrics, and governance voting data.

Detailed system diagrams and flowcharts will be added in the `/docs/architecture/` directory.

## Development Progress

Development is organized into multiple phases:

### Phase 1 - Research and Planning
- ‚úÖ Problem definition and use case exploration
- ‚úÖ Market research and feasibility study
- ‚úÖ Initial system architecture design

### Phase 2 - MVP Development
- üîÑ Smart contract prototypes
- üîÑ UI/UX design and wireframes
- üîÑ Backend service integration

### Phase 3 - Testing and Launch
- ‚è≥ Testnet deployment
- ‚è≥ Community onboarding
- ‚è≥ Pilot program in target regions

Development updates and sprint reports can be found in the `/progress` folder.

## Governance

Ridechain follows the Project Catalyst proposal lifecycle. Governance activities include:

- Proposal submission and feedback
- Voting by Cardano community members
- Fund allocation reports
- Community governance updates

See the `governance/` folder for minutes from community calls, proposal status, and voter guides.
